i
thought
the
king
had
more
affected
the
duke
of
albany
than
cornwall
it
did
always
seem
so
to
us
but
now
in
the
division
of
the
kingdom
it
appears
not
which
of
the
dukes
he
values
most
for
equalities
are
so
weighed
that
curiosity
in
neither
can
make
choice
of
eithers
moiety
is
not
this
your
son
my
lord
his
breeding
sir
hath
been
at
my
charge
have
so
often
blushed
to
acknowledge
him
that
now
am
brazed
to
it
cannot
conceive
you
sir
this
young
fellows
mother
could
whereupon
she
grew
roundwombed
and
had
indeed
sir
a
son
for
her
cradle
ere
she
had
a
husband
for
her
bed
do
you
smell
a
fault
cannot
wish
the
fault
undone
the
issue
of
it
being
so
proper
but
have
sir
a
son
by
order
of
law
some
year
elder
than
this
who
yet
is
no
dearer
in
my
account
though
this
knave
came
something
saucily
into
the
world
before
he
was
sent
for
yet
was
his
mother
fair
there
was
good
sport
at
his
making
and
the
whoreson
must
be
acknowledged
do

our

intent
to
shake
all

from

conferring
them
on
younger
strengths
while

my
noble

my
lord
of

we
first
address
towards
you
who
with
this
king
hath
rivalld
for
our
daughter
what
in
the
least
will
you
require
in
present
dower
with
her
or
cease
your
quest
of
love
most
royal
majesty
crave
no
more
than
what
your
highness
offerd
nor
will
you
tender
less
right
noble
burgundy
when
she
was
dear
to
us
we
did
hold
her
so
but
now
her
price
is
falln
sir
there
she
stands
if
aught
within
that
little
seeming
substance
or
all
of
it
with
our
displeasure
pieced
and
nothing
more
may
fitly
like
your
grace
shes
there
and
she
is
yours
know
no
answer
will
you
with
those
infirmities
she
owes
unfriended
newadopted
to
our
hate
dowerd
with
our
curse
and
strangerd
with
our
oath
take
her
or
leave
her
pardon
me
royal
sir
election
makes
not
up
on
such
conditions
then
leave
her
sir
for
by
the
power
that
made
me
tell
you
all
her
wealth
to
for
you
great
king
would
not
from
your
love
make
such
a
stray
to
match
you
where
hate
therefore
beseech
you
to
avert
your
liking
a
more
worthier
way
than
on
a
wretch
whom
nature
is
ashamed
almost
to
acknowledge
hers
this
is
most
strange
that
she
that
even
but
now
was
your
best
object
the
argument
of
your
praise
balm
of
your
age
most
best
most
dearest
should
in
this
trice
of
time
commit
a
thing
so
monstrous
to
dismantle
so
many
folds
of
favour
sure
her
offence
must
be
of
such
unnatural
degree
that
monsters
it
or
your
forevouchd
affection
falln
into
taint
which
to
believe
of
her
must
be
a
faith
that
reason
without
miracle
could
never
plant
in
me
yet
beseech
your
majesty
if
for
want
that
glib
and
oily
art
to
speak
and
purpose
not
since
what
well
intend
ill
dot
before
speakthat
you
make
known
it
is
no
vicious
blot
murder
or
foulness
no
unchaste
action
or
dishonourd
step
that
hath
deprived
me
of
your
grace
and
favour
but
even
for
want
of
that
for
which
am
richer
stillsoliciting
eye
and
such
a
tongue
as
am
glad
have
not
though
not
to
have
it
hath
lost
me
in
your
liking
better
thou
hadst
not
been
born
than
not
to
have
pleased
me
better
is
it
but
thisa
tardiness
in
nature
which
often
leaves
the
history
unspoke
that
it
intends
to
do
my
lord
of
burgundy
what
say
you
to
the
lady
loves
not
love
when
it
is
mingled
with
regards
that
stand
aloof
from
the
entire
point
will
you
have
her
she
is
herself
a
dowry
royal

give
but
that
portion
which
yourself
proposed
and
here
take
cordelia
by
the
hand
duchess
of
burgundy
nothing

sworn
am
firm

sorry
then
you
have
so
lost
a

that
you
must
lose
a

peace
be
with

since
that
respects
of

his

strange
that
from
their
coldst
neglect
my

should
kindle
to
inflamed
respect
thy
dowerless
daughter
king
thrown
to
my
chance

and
bid
farewell
to
your

jewels
of
our
father
with
washd
eyes
cordelia
leaves
you
know
you
what
you
are
and
like
a
sister
am
most
loath
to
call
your
faults
as
they
are
named
use
well
our
father
to
your
professed
bosoms
commit
him
but
yet
alas
stood
within
his
grace
would
prefer
him
to
a
better
place
so
farewell
to
you
both
prescribe
not
us
our
duties
let
your
study
be
to
content
your
lord
who
hath
received
you
at
fortunes
alms
you
have
obedience
scanted
and
well
are
worth
the
want
that
you
have
wanted
time
shall
unfold
what
plaited
cunning
hides
who
cover
faults
at
last
shame
them
derides
well
may
you
prosper
come
my
fair
cordelia
exeunt
and
sister
it
is
not
a
little
have
to
say
of
what
most
nearly
appertains
to
us
both
think
our
father
will
hence
tonight
thats
most
certain
and
with
you
next
month
with
us
you
see
how
full
of
changes
his
age
is
the
observation
we
have
made
of
it
hath
not
been
little
he
always
loved
our
sister
most
and
with
what
poor
judgment
he
hath
now
cast
her
off
appears
too
grossly
tis
the
infirmity
of
his
age
yet
he
hath
ever
but
slenderly
known
himself
the
best
and
soundest
of
his
time
hath
been
but
rash
then
must
we
look
to
receive
from
his
age
not
alone
the
imperfections
of
longengraffed
condition
but
therewithal
the
unruly
waywardness
that
infirm
and
choleric
years
bring
with
them
such
unconstant
starts
are
we
like
to
have
from
him
as
this
of
kents
banishment
there
is
further
compliment
of
leavetaking
between
france
and
him
pray
you
lets
hit
together
if
our
father
carry
authority
with
such
dispositions
as
he
bears
this
last
surrender
of
his
will
but
offend
us
we
shall
further
think
ont
we
must
do
something

never
my

till
you
can
derive
from
him
better
testimony
of
his

you
shall
run
a
certain
course
where
if
you
violently
proceed
against
him
mistaking
his
purpose
it
would
make
a
great
gap
in
your
own
honour
and
shake
in
pieces
the
heart
of
his
obedience
dare
pawn
down
my
life
for

withal
these
late
eclipses
in
the
sun
and

portend
no
good
to
us
though
the
wisdom
of
nature
can
reason
it
thus
and
thus
yet
nature
finds
itself
scourged
by
the
sequent
effects

this
is
the
excellent
foppery
of
the

that
when
we
are
sick
in

the
surfeit
of
our

behaviorwe
make
guilty
of
our
disasters
the

as
if
we
were
villains
by
necessity
fools
by
heavenly
compulsion
knaves
thieves
and
treachers
by
spherical
predominance
drunkards
liars
and
adulterers
by
an
enforced
obedience
of
planetary
influence
and
all
that
we
are
evil
in
by
a
divine
thrusting
on
an
admirable
evasion
of
whoremaster
man
to
lay
his
goatish
disposition
to
the
charge
of
a
star
my
father
compounded
with
my
mother
under

this
is
some
fellow
who
having

praised
for
bluntness
doth
affect
saucy
roughness
and
constrains
the
garb
quite
from
his
nature
he
cannot
flatter
he
an
honest
mind
and
plain
he
must
speak
truth
an
they

take
it

hes

these
kind
of
knaves
know
which
in

verity
under

suitors
when

of
their
perpetual
displeasure
neither

entreat
for
him
nor
any
way
sustain
him
most
savage
and
unnatural
go
to
say
you
nothing
theres
a
division
betwixt
the
dukes
and
a
worse
matter
than
that
have
received
a
letter
this
night

dangerous
to
be
spoken
have
locked
the
letter
in
my
closet
these
injuries

now
bears
will
be
revenged
home
theres
part
of

incline
to

fair
deserving

which
my

than
all
the
younger
rises
when
the
old
doth
fall
exit

where
the
greater
malady
is
fixd
the
lesser

if
thy
flight
lay
toward

thouldst
meet
the
bear
i
the
mouth
when
the

free
the

delicate
the
tempest
in

doth
from
my

take
all

horrible
steep
hark

low
the
crows

choughs
that
wing
the
midway
air
show
scarce
so
gross
as
beetles
half
way
down
hangs
one
that
gathers
samphire
dreadful
trade
methinks
he
seems
no
bigger
than
his
head
the
fishermen
that
walk
upon
the
beach
appear
like
mice
and
yond
tall
anchoring
bark
diminishd
to
her
cock
her
cock
a
buoy
almost
too
small
for

the
murmuring
surge
that
on
the
unnumberd
idle
pebbles
chafes
cannot
be
heard
so
high
ill
look
no

topple
down
headlong
set

where
you
stand
give

your

you
are

of

extreme
verge
for

good
sir
with
all
my
heart
why

thus
with
his
despair
is
done
to
cure
it
kneeling
you
mighty
gods
this
world
do
renounce
and
in
your
sights
shake
patiently
my
great
affliction
off
if
could
bear
it
longer
and
not
fall
to
quarrel
with
your
great
opposeless
wills
my
snuff
and
loathed
part
of
nature
should
burn
itself
out
if
edgar

bless
him
now
fellow
fare
thee
well
he
falls
forward
gone
sir
farewell
and
yet
know
not
how
conceit
may
rob
the
treasury
of
life
when
life
itself
yields
to
the
theft
had
he
been
where
he
thought
by
this
had
thought
been
past
alive
or
dead
ho
you
sir
friend
hear
you
sir
speak
thus
might
he
pass
indeed
yet
he
revives
what
are
you

wretchedness
deprived

comfort
when

two
full

had
a
thousand

whelkd
and

preserved
thee

thought
